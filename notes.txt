Overview of Solution
--------------------



What I Would Change With More Time
----------------------------------

- ingest script should make use of django models, drop direct use of postgres
- should have separate tables for calculated graph data
- ingest script should populate aforementioned graph data tables
- caching of graph data of some description e.g. redis

Limitations
-----------

- graph values should be bulk calculated and cached based on historic data
- more historic data should be loaded
- type of property text should be drawn on top of lines
- scale of graphs should respond better to the width and density of the data set
- mechanism for choosing window of data should be improved, like http://bl.ocks.org/DStruths/9c042e3a6b66048b5bd4
- if a category has no values the name text floats in the top left instead of not being added
- over large data sets the dots obscure the results and outliers also make it uneven
- data sets with many missing values can look strange; 'basis' lines may look better than cardinal here
- windows of data less than a year don't show the year on the x axis
- no mocking has severely limited test scope
- no mechanism for creating a temporary database has severely limited test scope
